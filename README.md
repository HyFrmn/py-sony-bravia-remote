`sony-bravia-remote` is a Python 3 library for interfacing remotely with Sony Bravia TV's. It utilizes a undocumented HTTP
API that the TV exposes. This allows you to control things like changing the volume, channel or turn the TV on and off.

This API is the exact same API that the "Sony Remote" app uses to control the TV.

## Installation
It's on Pip!

```bash
pip install sony-bravia-remote
```
